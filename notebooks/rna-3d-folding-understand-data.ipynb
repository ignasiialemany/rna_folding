{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# Introduction\nNormally, I start with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) script and dive straight into the data. However, this time the topic is more complex, requiring a deeper understanding before analysis is possible. To build a solid foundation, let’s start with the fundamental question:\n\n**What is RNA? Why is it important? And why does its 3D structure matter?**\n\n---\n\n## What is RNA?\nRNA (Ribonucleic Acid) is a **nucleic acid**, a type of biological macromolecule, similar to DNA but with key differences in structure and function. It plays a crucial role in genetics and cellular biology.\n\n### Differences between RNA and DNA\n| Feature          | DNA                      | RNA                      |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Sugar           | Deoxyribose               | Ribose                   |\n| Strands         | Double-stranded (mostly, forming a **double helix**)  | Single-stranded (mostly) |\n| Bases          | A, T, C, G                 | A, **U**, C, G (Uracil replaces Thymine) |\n| Stability       | More stable               | Less stable (prone to degradation) |\n| Function        | **Genetic storage, replication** (stores hereditary information in cells) | **Protein synthesis, regulation, catalysis** (actively involved in gene expression) |\n\n### **DNA as the Blueprint of Life**\nDNA is **the genetic material in all known living organisms**. It carries the instructions for the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of cells. The **double-helix structure** ensures that genetic information is stored safely and can be accurately copied during **cell division** (mitosis and meiosis). Every cell in an organism contains the same DNA, which acts as the \"blueprint\" for making proteins that define cellular function.\n\n---\n\n## **Types of RNA**\nRNA comes in different forms, each with distinct functions that work together to **convert genetic information into proteins**. The three main types of RNA directly involved in **protein synthesis** are:\n\n### **1. Messenger RNA (mRNA) – The Genetic Courier**\n- **Function:** Carries genetic instructions from DNA to ribosomes to synthesize proteins. It is a temporary copy of a gene used to direct protein synthesis.\n- **Example:** **mRNA vaccines** (e.g., Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) work by introducing a synthetic mRNA sequence that cells use to produce a viral protein, training the immune system to recognize and fight the virus.\n\n### **2. Transfer RNA (tRNA) – The Adapter Molecule**\n- **Function:** Brings amino acids to the ribosome, matching them with the corresponding mRNA codon.\n- **Structure:** It has a **cloverleaf** shape and an **anticodon region** that pairs with mRNA codons.\n- **Example:** If mRNA has the codon `AUG` (Methionine), tRNA carries the corresponding amino acid (Methionine) and adds it to the growing protein chain.\n\n### **3. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) – The Protein Factory**\n- **Function:** Forms the core of ribosomes and catalyzes peptide bond formation between amino acids.\n- **Highly conserved:** Used in evolutionary studies to compare species.\n- **Example:** The ribosome consists of both rRNA and proteins, acting as the **assembly site for proteins**.\n\n### **4. Small Nuclear RNA (snRNA) – The Gene Editor**\n- **Function:** Involved in **RNA processing**, especially **splicing**, which removes non-coding sequences (**introns**) from pre-mRNA before it becomes mature mRNA.\n- **Example:** Helps form the **spliceosome**, a molecular machine that cuts out introns and joins exons together, allowing different proteins to be produced from the same gene.\n\n### **5. MicroRNA (miRNA) & Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) – The Gene Silencers**\n- **Function:** Regulate gene expression by binding to mRNA and preventing translation or promoting degradation.\n- **Example:** miRNAs are involved in **cancer suppression** by regulating oncogenes (cancer-causing genes). siRNA is used in **gene therapy** to silence disease-causing genes.\n\n---\n\n## **Why is RNA important?**\nRNA is fundamental in biology and medicine because it acts as a bridge between genetic information (DNA) and functional molecules (proteins).\n\n### **1. Role in Protein Synthesis**\nRNA is central to the **central dogma of molecular biology**:\n\n**DNA → RNA → Protein**\n\n- **Transcription:** DNA is transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus.\n- **Translation:** mRNA is translated into proteins by ribosomes (rRNA + tRNA) in the cytoplasm.\n- **Example of the process:**\n  1. DNA: `TAC GGC TAA`\n  2. mRNA: `AUG CCG AUU`\n  3. tRNA brings the corresponding amino acids: Methionine - Proline - Isoleucine\n  4. The ribosome links these amino acids together to form a protein.\n\n### **2. Gene Regulation & Cell Function**\nRNA is not just a passive messenger; it actively regulates gene expression.\n- **miRNA and siRNA** silence genes by binding to mRNA and blocking translation.\n- **Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)** influences chromatin structure and gene expression.\n- **Riboswitches** change their conformation to regulate gene activity based on environmental conditions.\n\n### **3. Importance in Evolution & Medicine**\n- RNA was likely the **first genetic material** in early life forms (**RNA world hypothesis**).\n- Many viruses, including **SARS-CoV-2**, use RNA as their genetic material.\n- **RNA-based drugs** and **RNA vaccines** are revolutionizing medicine.\n\n---\n## **What is 3D RNA folding?**\nUnlike DNA, RNA does not stay linear. It **folds into complex structures** that determine its function.\n\n### **Levels of RNA Structure**\n1. **Primary Structure**: The sequence of nucleotides (A, U, C, G).\n2. **Secondary Structure**: Local folding patterns (stems, loops, bulges).\n3. **Tertiary Structure**: The full **3D shape** stabilized by interactions.\n\n### **Key Folding Elements**\n- **Hairpin loops**: Short double-stranded stems with a loop at the end.\n- **Pseudoknots**: Complex folds where loops interact with other RNA regions.\n- **Coaxial stacking**: Stacking of helices for stability.\n\nRNA folding is **not random**—it follows **thermodynamic principles** to find the most stable conformation.\n\n---\n\n## **Why do we need to study 3D RNA folding?**\nThe **3D structure determines RNA function**, affecting its ability to interact with other molecules.\n\n### **1. RNA-Protein Interactions**\n- Ribosomes, CRISPR, and viral replication depend on RNA-protein binding.\n\n### **2. Drug Design & Synthetic Biology**\n- Many drugs target RNA structures (e.g., antibiotics targeting rRNA).\n- Artificially designed RNA molecules can be used in therapy.\n\n---\n\n## **How does RNA 3D folding work?**\nRNA folds due to various **molecular forces** and stabilizing factors.\n\n### **1. Key Forces in RNA Folding**\n- **Hydrogen bonding**: Base pairing (A-U, G-C).\n- **Stacking interactions**: π-π interactions between bases.\n- **Metal ion stabilization**: Mg²⁺ ions stabilize tertiary structures.\n\n### **2. Experimental Methods to Study RNA Folding**\n- **X-ray crystallography**: High-resolution but difficult for RNA.\n- **NMR spectroscopy**: Good for small RNAs.\n- **Cryo-EM**: Ideal for large RNA complexes like ribosomes.\n\n### **3. Computational Approaches**\n- **RNAfold**: Predicts 2D structures based on thermodynamics.\n- **Rosetta & AlphaFold RNA**: AI-driven 3D structure prediction.\n- **Molecular dynamics simulations**: Simulates RNA folding over time.\n\n---\n\n## **Challenges & Future Directions**\nDespite progress, RNA structure prediction remains a challenge.\n\n### **1. Predicting RNA Structures is Difficult**\n- Experimental methods are slow and expensive.\n- Computational models still struggle with large, complex RNAs.\n\n### **2. Combining Experimental & Computational Approaches**\n- Integrating lab data (e.g., Cryo-EM) with AI models improves accuracy.\n\n### **3. AI & Deep Learning in RNA Folding**\n- **AlphaFold RNA** is emerging as a powerful tool.\n- Machine learning could revolutionize RNA-based drug discovery.\n\n---\n### **Modern Approaches in RNA Structure Prediction**\nPredicting RNA 3D structures is a complex challenge that combines experimental and computational techniques. In recent years, **AI-driven models** have significantly improved RNA structure prediction.\n\n- **RNAfold**: A widely used thermodynamic model that predicts RNA secondary structures based on minimum free energy.\n- **Rosetta**: A computational tool that models RNA tertiary structures using fragment-based assembly and molecular dynamics.\n- **AlphaFold RNA**: A deep learning-based approach, inspired by AlphaFold for proteins, aiming to predict RNA 3D structures with high accuracy.\n\nBy integrating **machine learning, molecular simulations, and experimental data**, these tools are paving the way for more precise RNA structural insights, benefiting **drug discovery, synthetic biology, and gene regulation studies**.\n\n### **Example: RNAfold in Drug Discovery**\nOne practical application of RNA structure prediction is in **drug discovery**. Many **antiviral drugs** target RNA structures to disrupt viral replication. For example, **RNAfold** has been used to predict the secondary structures of **SARS-CoV-2 RNA elements**, helping researchers identify potential drug-binding sites. This approach aids in the design of **RNA-targeted therapeutics**, which could be crucial for treating RNA viruses and genetic disorders.\n\n\n\n## **Final Thoughts**\nUnderstanding RNA and its 3D folding is crucial for biology, medicine, and technology. By combining experimental and computational approaches, researchers can unlock new possibilities in **drug design, genetic engineering, and synthetic biology**.\n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# EDA"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport subprocess\nimport re\nimport networkx as nx\nimport torch\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Decide between local or kaggle cloud storage         \nKAGGLE_ENV = 'kaggle' in os.listdir('/')\ndata_path = '/kaggle/input' if KAGGLE_ENV else '../kaggle/input'\n\nif KAGGLE_ENV:\n    !pip install torch_geometric torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.0.0+cpu.html\n    !apt-get update && apt-get install -y vienna-rna\n\nfrom torch_geometric.data import Data\n    \nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk(data_path):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename)) "},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Load Data"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"file_paths = {\n    \"df_sample_submission_sunny\": data_path + \"/standford-rna-3d-folding-sunny/sample_submission.csv\",\n    \"df_test_sequences_sunny\": data_path + \"/standford-rna-3d-folding-sunny/test_sequences.csv\",\n    \"df_train_labels_sunny\": data_path + \"/standford-rna-3d-folding-sunny/train_labels.csv\",\n    \"df_train_sequences_sunny\": data_path + \"/standford-rna-3d-folding-sunny/train_sequences.csv\",\n    \"df_validation_labels\": data_path + \"/stanford-rna-3d-folding/validation_labels.csv\",\n    \"df_sample_submission\": data_path + \"/stanford-rna-3d-folding/sample_submission.csv\",\n    \"df_test_sequences\": data_path + \"/stanford-rna-3d-folding/test_sequences.csv\",\n    \"df_validation_sequences\": data_path + \"/stanford-rna-3d-folding/validation_sequences.csv\",\n    \"df_train_labels\": data_path + \"/stanford-rna-3d-folding/train_labels.csv\",\n    \"df_train_sequences\": data_path + \"/stanford-rna-3d-folding/train_sequences.csv\"\n}\n\nfor var_name, path in file_paths.items():\n    try:\n        globals()[var_name] = pd.read_csv(path)\n        print(f\"{var_name} load, {globals()[var_name].shape[0]} rows, {globals()[var_name].shape[1]} columns.\")\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"file not found: {path}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"error .. {path}: {e}\")"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## df_train (RNA sequences)\nStart with the RNA sequences (df_train) and have a look about the features.\nLet's start with the first row:\n- target_id , 1SCL_A, the name of the RNA is 1SCL and the letter A is about the chain (RNA can have multiple chains).

By converting sequences into numerical representations, we can check if specific K-mer patterns correlate with stable or unstable 3D structures. This can improve the predictive power of our models.\n\nNext, K-mers can reveal structural motifs. Many RNA folding elements, such as hairpins or pseudoknots, are linked to specific sequence patterns. By analyzing frequent K-mers, we might detect biologically relevant motifs that contribute to RNA stability. Comparing them with predictions from RNAfold or 3D modeling tools can help validate their importance.\n\nAnother approach is clustering sequences based on K-mer distributions. If sequences with similar K-mer profiles tend to form similar 3D structures, this could provide valuable insights into RNA folding principles.\n\nFinally, if we have ground truth 3D structures, we can compare our K-mer results to see if specific patterns consistently appear in certain structural elements.
