1. Code Audit:
Review Openanalyzedules for protein-specific assumptions.

2. Tokenization Update:
Define a new tokenization scheme for RNA nucleotides (e.g., A, C, G, U) and a masked token.

3. MSA Processing:
Adapt parsers to handle RNA FASTA files and RNA-specific MSAs.

4. Feature Extraction:
Modify extraction pipelines to include RNA-specific features (e.g., base pairing, secondary structure).

5.Model Architecture:
Update embedding layers and adjust transformer modules if necessary.
Integrate or modify masking mechanisms (masked_msa_token) for RNA.

6.Dataset Preparation:
Curate RNA structure data and generate corresponding RNA MSAs.
Prepare training, validation, and testing splits.

7.Training Setup:
Update configuration files (hyperparameters, learning rates, etc.) for RNA training.
Define RNA-specific evaluation metrics.

8.Experimentation & Iteration:
Run pilot experiments, analyze errors, and refine the model.
